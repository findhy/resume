      <p> My work at Opera was divided over two areas, quality
      assurance and research and development. </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p> As part of my QA involvement, I decided to write and run
        an automated visual regression testing
        system, which I subsequently pushed to have extended
        to cover multiple platforms and multiple development branches.
        This revolutionised the quality assurance process at Opera,
        since before this time no regular automated testing was
        performed. </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p> I also pushed hard to have strict test case
        authoring guidelines put in place. Combined with my
        involvement in the creation of more efficient processes for
        handling bugs, this dramatically increased the quality of
        standards testing at Opera. </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p> In addition I also carried out the usual array of QA
        duties: daily product testing, ad-hoc testing, comprehensive
        focussed testing, test suite development, test suite review,
        bug reporting, bug triage, etc.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p> As part of my R&amp;D involvement, I was heavily involved
        in Opera's work with the W3C, representing Opera on
        various working groups (CSS, CDF, XBL). In response
        to growing concern with the direction of the W3C, I managed to
        get Apple, Mozilla and Opera co-operating and coordinated the
        announcement of <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">the WHATWG
        group</a>. I have been acting as the group's specification
        editor and spokesman, taking input from the public and
        continually updating the group's two major proposed
        specifications in the open. </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p> The first WHATWG proposal was <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/">Web
        Forms 2</a>, a major update to HTML4's forms
        features, intended as a backwards-compatible alternative to
        W3C's XForms. This draft is mostly stable.
       </p></li>
       <li>
        <p> The second WHATWG proposal, still in heavy development, is
        <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">Web
        Applications 1.0</a> (now HTML5), effectively a complete revision
        of HTML4 and the related DOM specifications, to bring
        HTML up to date with requirements for Web-based application
        development.

        regarding future product development, etc...</p>
